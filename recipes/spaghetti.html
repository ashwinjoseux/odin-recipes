        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dried spaghetti noodles (450g)</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground meat like ground beef, ground turkey, or bulk Italian sausage (450g)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion (130g)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced, 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the meat: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the meat cooks.

</li>
<li>
   Add liquid and tomatoes: Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, ¾ teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. 
</li>
<li>
  Cook spaghetti: About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time. Drain.  
</li>
<li>
    To serve: Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and leave for a minute so that it absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.
</li>
        </ol>
